## What is DeClustor?

Managing AWS ECS environments can be challenging due to fragmented metrics and real-time performance monitoring across clusters. AWS's dashboard can be confusing and lacks a unified interface.

DeClustor offers a centralized solution for seamless ECS monitoring and management, enabling effortless tracking of metrics and real-time performance across multiple services within a single ECS cluster.
